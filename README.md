Discoverability for gene search

Gene Hints is a reusable UI component backed by static data.  It makes gene search more discoverable by finding and showing interesting genes across the genome.  Users can then click genes to search them.

Gene Hints is designed to augment gene search in any web application, and requires no backend to operate.
