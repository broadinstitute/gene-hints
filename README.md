Discoverability for gene search

[Gene Hints](https://broad.io/gene-hints) is a reusable UI component backed by genomic data.  It makes gene search more discoverable by finding and showing interesting genes across the genome.  Users can then click genes to search them.

Gene Hints complements existing gene search in any web application, and requires no backend to operate.

# Explore gene search visually
## Show interesting genes by default
Here, a manually curated set of gene hints -- based on the most cited genes -- is shown for human.

## Tooltips give more context
Hover over ACE2, and see its significance: it's the entry point for COVID-19 virus.

## Related genes provide hints for downstream exploration
Find out genes that are similar to or interact with our searched gene, ACE2.

## Adaptive context
A tooltip shows in which pathway the AGT gene interacts with the searched gene.

## Support for multiple species
Gene Hints works for other mouse and rat, too!  Tooltips show the significance and citation counts for a popular mouse gene.
