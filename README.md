Discoverability for gene search

[Gene Hints](https://broad.io/gene-hints) is a reusable UI component backed by genomic data.  It makes gene search more discoverable by finding and showing interesting genes across the genome.  Users can then click genes to search them.

Gene Hints complements existing gene search in any web application, and requires no backend to operate.
